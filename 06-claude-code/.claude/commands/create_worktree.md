Your task is to create a new worktree named '$ARGUMENTS' in the .trees/$ARGUMENTS folder.

  Follow these steps:

  1. Check if an existing folder .trees folder with the name $ARGUMENTS already exists. If it does, stop here and tell the user the worktree already exists.
  2. Create a new git worktree in the .trees folder with the name $ARGUMENTS.
  3. Symlink the .venv folder into the worktree directory.
  4. Launches a new VSCode editor instance in that directory by running the 'code' command.
